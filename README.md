These are a collection of some of my solutions. I will not post solutions above #100 due to the rules of the site.

For problems which I am able, I attempted to upload my original solution and then any modifications will be part of the update history for that file.

Many of the problems pull from "Primes.hs", which has all the logic needed for dealing with prime numbers, plus some other things that I was just playing around with, and have not actually yet been able to utilize.
