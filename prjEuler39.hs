{--If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

{--
Note that
 a = min (a,b,c), a+a+a=3a<=a+b+c=p, we get a <= p/3.
 c = max (a,b,c), c+c+c=3c>=a+b+c=p, so c>= p `div` 3.

The latter is not as useful because it is two thirds of the range. 
            
Note pythagoreans exist of the form (a,b,b+1), so suppose a is very small.
 
Then a + b + b +1 ~= 2b +1 ~= p. Then b must go up to (p-1)div2 in the worst case.
More exactly, a + 2b + 1 = p for the worst case for b, so
b = (p-1-a)/2.
